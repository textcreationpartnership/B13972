            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISCOVRSE WRITTEN from the French Kings Campe, lying before Noyan, the viii. day of August, Anno 1591.</head>
            <div type="discourse">
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE town of Noyan being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legur'd by the kinges Maiestye, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitye: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe wher of, the L. Vicount Tauanes set forwardes towardes the the said towne, and came thither in the night season, accompanied with foure hundred horse, and about fiue hundred footmen: Yet such was his bad successe in his pretence for succouring the town of Noyan, that his whol power was broken, slaine, discomfited, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:176854:3"/>prisoners: and more then that, to the great griefe of the Leagers, himself was taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the assault sore wounded.</p>
               <p>This newes being brought to the forces of the Leaguers, caused the Duke D'Aumaule to resolue an attempt for his releasement: and thereupon hauing assembled about fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horse, came and made his generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the towne of Han, which is not aboue four leagues from the sayde Noyan. From whence, on the seuenth of August, hee sent three hundred of his best horse to the fight, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a company of Harquebuziers, who went before, and the sayd Horsemen lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered behind in a village, not farre from the rereward, who soon after set forward, and gaue a charge vpon the quarter of the Kings light horse, where they were well receaued. With him there came to the said alarme, the Lords of Largue, and of Lawney, his brother, with their companies, who are of some force. These ioyntly ioyned with the light horsemen, greatly strengthned the forces of the leaguers. Neuerthelesse, after many charges, and sharpe assaults geuen on either part (the Kings side al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hauing the greatest likelihood of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) both the companies began to retire.</p>
               <p>At which retire came in that valiant soldier
<pb facs="tcp:176854:3"/>and honourable man at armes, the Lord Baron of Biron, who albeit that he was not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with aboue twelue of his own men, yet the Kings forces supposing he had brought in some store of fresh soldiers, so soone as they once heard him named, took a wonderful and vnspeakable courage, and seeing him in the midst of them, they gaue a fresh charge vpon the enemie, in such sort, and with such force, that they did driue the enemie euen into the gates of Han, from whence they had issued. To whom there was also comming a new succor, and fresh supply of men, who perceiuing the euill successe of the rest, returned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frunt, so that some of the kings maiesties forces followed them euen into their barriours.</p>
               <p>This fight was great, for there were at the least twelue seuerall charges and assaultes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, in which there was some store of armed men slaine on the enemies side, with diuers of their Captains. Among whom was slayn Don Francisco of Gueuara, the best captain of light horsemen that the king of Spayne had in the low Countreys. The Lieutenant to the sayde Francisco de Gueuara, was also slayn outright. It is supposed that the Lieutenant to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of Han was also taken and slaine, with sundrie other of great account.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:176854:4"/>
               <p> The Lord of Long-champ, one of the best and most aduenturous Captaines, is also taken prisoner, with aboue fourscore men at aimes of account, and diuers Leaders, and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the horsemen: who all confesse, that they were hardly bestead, hotly encountred and assaulted by men of courage, and great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Yea this ouerthrow cost them deare: for there was taken and slaine of the enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fifteen hundred horse, who were not of the worst, but of their chiefest horse and hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>On the Kings Maiesties side there was slaine about a dossen horses, which were of his light horsemen. Amongest whom the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall of the companie was slaine: his death is greatly bewayled, forasmuch as he was a man of great valor, and wonderfull courage.</p>
               <p>The Duke de Maine arriued on the seuenth day of August, at the towne of Han, with all troupes of horsemen which he could gather: Of whom it need not be doubted, but that hee is of the opinion to recouer this losse, and to speed better then the rest of his chief captains did before him. Wherein if it may please God he fayle in his opinion, and obteine but the like successe, his forces would shortly be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his faction for the most parte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:176854:4"/>
               <p> This one thing is worthy the noting, that all men are now more willing to goe against him and his troupes, then they were against those that came first. And it may very well be, that sith the Duke de Main is not content with the two first losses and conflicts which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that the next may worke some greater effect: for it was likely (being then so neere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as they were) that they should hardly part againe without comming neerer in viewe and battel one of the other.</p>
               <p>In the meane space the Kings Maiesty lost no time about the siege of this towne: For on this day, being the seuenth day of August, the Canon beganne to play vpon a Church that standeth in the midst of the suburbs, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a great ditch, did strongly defend the same: wherby it is not found much weaker then the towne: the taking whereof could not but minister great occasion of aduauntage, wherof the Kings Maiestie was in good hope. Neuerthelesse, he was coustrayned to leaue of and to restraine the forraine power which came vnto him from Germanie and England, who in most honourable sort are entered the Realme.</p>
               <p>The Church aforesaide hauing receiued the force of the Canon, which played vpon it from morning vntill three of the clocke in the
<pb facs="tcp:176854:5"/>after noone, had by that time a great breache made into the same: By meanes whereof, the Church was soone taken by a fierce assault made by the French and English companies. In which breach there was slayne about the number of thirtie enemies, besides whom there was to the number of fourty and fiue, that were retired into the vaultes of the sayde Church, who yeelded themselues vnto the mercie of the Kinges Maiestie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon hee immediately graunted them their liues, and likewise liberty to depart with bag and baggage.</p>
               <p>The assaultes of the towne, and winning of this Church, was the meanes for taking the Suburbs, and therefore a thing preiudiciall to the towne, not onelye in respecte of the anoyance which the Kings forces did offer the enemie: but also for the men of war that were there slayne, of which the towne was but meanely and slenderly furnished at the time of their yeelding.</p>
               <p>His Maiestie is aduertised that Rosue, who ledde the Duke de Maine his army towardes Lorraine, is returned towards Laon, to which place the Duke is gone to ioyne with him, to the ende that they together might succour the said towne. By meanes wherof, there is likelihood of a great battaile and conflict very
<pb facs="tcp:176854:5"/>shortly to be geuen to the Duke de Maine, the rather, in respect that his Maiestie, and all the Nobilitie about him, stand very resolutely in his defence.</p>

               <p>VPon the xix. day following, the saide composition was put in effect as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and his Maiestie hauing aduise that the enemy retired vpon <hi>la Fere,</hi> presently resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to depart after midnight with xij. hundred horse and foure hundred harguebuziers on horsebacke, the Lord Marshall of Biron being of the troupe, to the end to crosse and meete with the enimie by the waie betweene la Fere and Loan, and to charge him in the march:
<pb facs="tcp:176854:6"/>there was great apparance, had the aduice bin true. Herevpon his Maiestie returned the sayd Lord Marshall, and retained with himselfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sixe hundred horse and the saide harguebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, and so marched toward Han, where the Duke of Maine remained yet with his sayd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, where his said Maiestie stayed almost two houres in battel in his sight within canon shot, whereof there weresome shot discharged with out anie losse, neither woulde there issue anie person, except one cornet of horsemen, which had the riuer of Some before them. Thus the Duke chose rather to abide this shame, than to seeke to reuenge the first. Euen against the towne there was also a Corps de gard of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who were displaced by eight Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that alighted. On another side there were some twelue that aduentured too farre, whom four Gentlemen (of whom Sir R. Williams was one) pursued, and made them turne their faces, except one of the chiefest, that belonged to the duke d'Aumal, who remaineth prisoner.</p>
               <p>His Maiestie on the twentieth of August marched toward Gisors, there to receaue the right honourable Earle of Essex, and so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ioyne with the great power of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, who are already entred into Fraunce, by Gods grace to work some great effect, with the ayde of the honourable, warlike, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Leaders, and Gentlemen of England.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His former discourse (gentle reader) is not forged or fained, as some perhaps for malice will pecuisly report: neither is it fetched from flying and fabulous letters, ordinarie reports on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or published vppon rash warrant, as some, I know, will not stick to vtter: but the same is set forth for such credit as cānot be disproued, being agreeable to the intelligence sent from his Maiestie into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to the Lord Ambassador for Fraunce. And although the same bee not published with such elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent phrases as some newes which hath lately beene published, yet will I assure you (if both were examined by the wisest) that this is of more trueth, and without error, notwithstanding that much trueth was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and little found but vntrueth. For reformatiō wherof, be assured there is sufficient order taken, that no newes whatsoeuer, shall hereafter passe in print, but that which is certain, and knowen to be true.</p>
               <p>Besides this, you shall very shortly haue published the good successe which the Lord Prince of Countie hath had in another part of Fraunce, in the behalfe of the French king: where he hath put a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Leaguers to the foyle. The maner of which
<pb facs="tcp:176854:7"/>battaile shalbe particularlie published, being transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the French printed Copie, with his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties owne letter sent vnto the said Prince of Countie, together with the honourable letter of Sir Roger Willyams, in the behalfe of his Countrey, sent vnto the Collonels and Captaines of Paris, challenging them to the combat, in respect of some false rumors giuen foorth by them against English companies, which therin is plainely layd open.</p>
